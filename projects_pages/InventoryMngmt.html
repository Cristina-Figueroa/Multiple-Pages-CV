<h1>Inventory Tracking Service - Databases Class Project</h1>
<sub> Aug 2023 - Dec 2023 </sub>
<p>
    As part of my database systems course, my team and I designed 
    and implemented a full-stack Inventory Tracking Service to 
    manage users, warehouses, parts, suppliers, and inventory 
    flow. We built a PostgreSQL database with E-R modeling and 
    schema design, implemented a Flask REST API to expose backend 
    functionality, and created a Voila dashboard in Jupyter Notebook 
    for real-time inventory visualization. Strengthened skills in 
    database design, backend implementation, and web programming concepts.
